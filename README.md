# hello-world
My first repository.
After a 15+ year career in marketing/advertising,
I decided to switch careers, go back to school,
and become a software engineer with no previous
experience.  It is scary, but like Nike,
I am just doing it!  I have always had an affinity
for tech.  I want to understand it, I want to be
the best I can be at my craft, and lastly, I want
to enhance the lives of people through technology.
I aspire to inspire others that look like me that
it is tough to go out on a limb, but that is where
the fruit is!  Fear is nothing but a facade that
hides the truth; the truth that you are able and
capable to accomplish anything as long as you are
committed to endure the fire which is a cost that
most people are not willing to pay.  I endured,
so can you!  It is the second greatest decision
I have made in my entire life!
